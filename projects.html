						<h2>GP Surgery</h2>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>Here is a video showcase of a quick GP Surgery Website I created while following the GOV.UK
							Guidlines. It features a log in for a Doctor, Patient and Admin of a local GP Surgery. I have attached PHP
								files which have been written out but are yet to be connected with a physical database.

						<h2>Homteq Company Website</h2>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>I really like how this website turned out. With the clean user interface and easy to use functionality. Equipped with a
							functional shopping basket and working sessions for different users as long as they are logged in is really brings it to life. 
							With a database connection it features SQL working with PHP to execute any statements.

						<h2>London Tourism Website</h2>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>This site was an early one for me, an unfinished website which features a vibrant colour scheme and
							has that simple look to it. Features responsivness and even turns the navbar into a whole drop down menu for
							mobile users if needed. The use of @media has been used throughout all my projects to show I care about how 
							responsive my sites are as that is very important. I also feature the hover effects in which I learnt while developing the site.
