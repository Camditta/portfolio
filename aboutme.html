						<p>My name is Cam, I was born in London and grew up learning so much in the world of technology due to my
							father working at Samsung. He would always bring home prototype phones in which I'd always
						have a fasination for. How were they built? Who made it? Could I do that in the future? I am making this portfolio website simply due to the fact that I know in my current state I will not be
						able to accomplish what I want to do in the future which is to become a software engineer. 
						I am currently learning a variety of different programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML + CSS and more.</p>

						<p>Currently, I am studying at the University of Westminster enrolled in a Bachelor Honours Degree in Software
							Engineering. I have covered a variety of different modules which will be displayed in a table below.
							Using the skills I have learnt along the way through my education, I am able to create this website and freely move
							elements around to my liking with ease. Whether it would be through flex-box or the grid display method.

									<tr>
										<td>Software Development 1+2</td>
										<td>Both Software Development modules covered different working cycles such as waterfall devloping or agile development
											and the pros and cons of both. Next to the programming part, I learnt both Java and Python. This includes the creation of complex functions and going
											over error handling and file manipulation. Syntax was learnt for both of these languages and how they differ.
										</td>

											JavaScript + REACT.JS + NODE.JS was all done under this module.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Machine Learning and Data Mining</td>
										<td>Introduction to ML and DM, the ethical and privacy context of real life application. The issues regarding suitability
											and pre-processing data. E.g. Data types, Noise, Bias and Overfitting as well as Dimensionality Reduction. Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning.
											Issues with Scalability and Large Data Sets and Emerging Market Trends.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Object Oriented Programming</td>
										<td>After learning Java, it was important to also learn about OOP and the importance of implementing it into our programs.
											I learnt OOP fundamentals, Classes and Objects, Usage of APIs and Packages. Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, 
											Access Specifiers, Absracts Classes and Interfaces. Also how to design classes using UML design and the creation of a GUI.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Database Systems</td>
										<td>DB Systems was very intresting to me as I learnt about how data is kept and laws behind it. I also learnt 
											how to develop these systems and build databases using SQL. Connecting my website to a DB system using PHP.
											Meaning this came with Server Sided Web Development and had experience with MongoDB and Amazon AWS.
